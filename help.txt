p:POS_X:POS_Y:POS_Z:RX:RY:RZ:UNUSED		plane with position, rotation and an unused but necessary value
s:POS_X:POS_Y:POS_Z:RX:RY:RZ:RADIUS		sphere with position, rotation and radius
c:POS_X:POS_Y:POS_Z:RX:RY:RZ:RADIUS		infinite cylinder with position, rotation and radius
h:POS_X:POS_Y:POS_Z:RX:RY:RZ:RADIUS:HEIGHT	finite cylinder with position, rotation, radius and height
x:POS_X:POS_Y:POS_Z:RX:RY:RZ:THETA		infinite hourglass with position, rotation and demi-angle of aperture
o:POS_X:POS_Y:POS_Z:RX:RY:RZ:THETA		infinite cone  with position, rotation and demi-angle of aperture
u:POS_X:POS_Y:POS_Z:RX:RY:RZ:THETA:HEIGHT	finite cone with position, rotation, demi-angle of aperture and height
